# Site Vision: Auramotora Transdisciplinary Portal

## 1. Vision

A one-page interactive EPK that functions as a "digital tapesty" of the band's history, music, and philosophy. It is not a static website; it is an avant-garde experiment where the user "traverses" the band's dystopian universe.

## 2. Sitemap

- **[index] Home / The Portal:** The entry point. Interactive fluid logo (Atmosphere).
- **[travesia] The Journey:** Narrative block about the band's origins and philosophy (Text-heavy but visually integrated).
- **[z3ro] The Legacy:** Interactive discography section focused on the Z3RO EP.
- **[echoes] Voices from the Void:** Live dates, history of cities, and shared stages.
- **[future] Transdisciplinary Future:** Contact, social links, and the 2024 vision.

## 3. Roadmap

- [ ] **Task 1: The Portal (Hero)** - Implementation of the reactive fluid landing with the Core Logo and band taglines.
- [ ] **Task 2: The Narrative (Bio)** - Integrating the Spanish history text into a fluid, anti-grid layout.
