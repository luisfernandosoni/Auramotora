# Site Vision: Auramotora Transdisciplinary Portal

## 1. Vision

A one-page interactive EPK that functions as a **"Grainy Digital Ritual."** It is not a static website; it is an avant-garde experiment where the user traverses a world of digital decay, distorted textures, and rough-cut storytelling.

## 2. Sitemap

- **[index] Home / The Portal:** The entry point. Interactive fluid logo (Atmosphere).
- **[travesia] The Journey:** Narrative block about the band's origins and philosophy (Text-heavy but visually integrated).
- **[z3ro] The Legacy:** Interactive discography section focused on the Z3RO EP.
- **[echoes] Voices from the Void:** Live dates, history of cities, and shared stages.
- **[future] Transdisciplinary Future:** Contact, social links, and the 2024 vision.

## 3. Roadmap

- [x] **Task 1: The Portal (Hero)** - Implementation of the reactive, grainy hero section.
- [x] **Task 2: The Narrative (Bio)** - Integrating the Spanish history text into a rough, asymmetrical layout.
- [ ] **Task 3: Discography (Z3RO)** - Grainy archive showcase of the 2019 EP.
- [ ] **Task 4: Global Networking** - Interactive list of cities and shared stages.
- [ ] **Task 5: Final Polish** - Universal Grain & Glitch layer integration.
