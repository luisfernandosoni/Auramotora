# Prompt: Auramotora EPK - The Living Poster Proposal

Build a state-of-the-art, avant-garde website that functions as a **"Living Poster"** for the band **Auramotora**. The design must be a direct digital evolution of the provided poster art—moving away from "clean UI" into a tactile, zine-like experience of digital decay and Latin American Surrealism.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**

- **Platform:** Web, Desktop-first
- **Theme:** "Latin Surrealist Poster" - Rough, Grainy, Visceral
- **Palette:**
  - **Void Black (#0A0A0A)** dominant background.
  - **Ultraviolet (#7D00FF)** and **Acid Green (#C1FF00)** for high-contrast glitches.
  - **Blood Orange (#FF4D00)** for visceral highlights (inspired by the poster's warm mist).
- **Textures:** Heavy Halftone dots, cinematic film grain, and viscous "liquid mist" background.
- **Typography:**
  - **PRIMARY HERO:** **The Band Logo** (provided asset). It must be the massive central presence.
  - **Headlines:** "Space Grotesk" with extreme letter-spacing and "VHS-warp" scanning distortions.
- **Layout:** "Shattered Canvas"—abandon the clean grid. Elements should feel "rough-cut" and asymmetrical, like pieces of a physical collage pasted onto a black void.

**Page Structure:**

1. **Hero: The Ritual Centerpiece:**
   - A massive, centered version of the **Auramotora Logo** (provided PNG) as the primary presence.
   - Background: A viscous, grainy mist in shades of deep red and ultraviolet that reacts to mouse movement.
   - Tagline: "Música distópica para la travesía" rendered with a halftone-jitter effect.
2. **Interface HUD:**
   - Minimalist corner labels: "[ 01_ARCHIVE ]", "[ 02_TRANSMISSION ]", "[ 03_INTERFACE ]".
   - HUD elements should "flicker" and show technical metadata (Depth scans, coordinates) in tiny Roboto Mono text.
3. **The Narrative Fragment (Bio):**
   - An asymmetrical content block featuring the band's history.
   - Use "Rough-cut" masks for the band portrait (provided asset).
   - Text should look like it was printed on a grainy, semi-translucent substrate.

**Specific Instructions:**

- **NO GENERIC FONTS for the main title.** Use the Logo asset prominently.
- **MAXIMUM GRIT.** Use CSS noise and radial-gradient halftone patterns.
- **PUNK FLYER VIBE.** The site should feel like a rare bootleg discovery, not a corporate console.
